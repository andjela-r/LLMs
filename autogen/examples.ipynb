      "### 3. **Enhance the Flow**:\n",
      "   - \"These facts highlight the urgency of addressing climate change to prevent further degradation of the planet.\"  \n",
      "   → **Suggestion**: \"These facts underscore the urgency of addressing climate change to prevent further degradation of the planet.\"\n",

      "### 4. **Add Visual or Imagery (if applicable)**:\n",
      "   - If you're preparing a presentation or report, you could add a visual (like a chart or a diagram) to illustrate the data points, such as:\n",
      "     - A graph showing the 1.1°C increase over the past 100 years.\n",
      "     - A comparison between pre-industrial and current climate conditions.\n",
